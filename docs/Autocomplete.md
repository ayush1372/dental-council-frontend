# create custom component - Autocomplete using materialUI

Material-UI is simply a library that allows us to import and use different components to create a user interface in our React applications.

-Create Page: Re-usable/custom Autocomplete component into `/src/Components/Autocomplete`

# npm package installation

-Install npm material ui packages required

-`npm i @material-ui/core`

# Develop Component

-Get the preferred dropdown select component from the offical documentation Mui.

- Home page Link: `https://mui.com/`.

-Export the created custom component of Autocomplete to re-usbale anywhere throughout the react-application.

# Benifits:

- We can add different props to send the data dynamically so that we prevent the DRY principle (Do not-Repeat Yourself) for mainly implementing custom compoonents.

-Accessing the content through the dropdown is easy for the UI users.
